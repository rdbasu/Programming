## RUST
[Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)


Rust empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains than you did before.
Take, for example, **“systems-level”** work that deals with low-level details of memory management, data representation, and concurrency.

**speed and memory usage**

## low-level systems programming
### CLI apps, web servers,...

**High-level ergonomics and low-level control**

*Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.*

*In Rust, the compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs.*

## Dependency Manager
Cargo, the included dependency manager and build tool, makes adding, compiling, and managing dependencies painless and consistent across the Rust ecosystem.
